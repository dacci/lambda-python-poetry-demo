# AWS Lambda demo project using Poetry and CodeBuild

This repository aims to demonstrate implementing [AWS Lambda function in Python](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/lambda-python.html) managed by [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/).

It also provides [build specification](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/build-spec-ref.html) example for building [deployment package](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/python-package.html) using AWS CodeBuild. See [buildspec.yml](buildspec.yml) for detail.
